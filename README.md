# PhysicsShmup

This code is for educational purposes.  You can use it in your own projects, just don't cheat and use this code
to try and replicate my project and screw me over, please.  But generally, none of this code here is proprietary,
meaning it's written broadly enough to be used in a wide variety of projects.  

What is this project?  It's a 2D side-scrolling shmup indie game that I (one person) am working on with LibGDX.  The intent is 
to sell this game on Steam, so at some point I will stop uploading code when it becomes proprietary-ish, but I figured since 
there aren't a lot of advanced tutorials on LibGDX around the web I'd put my code up here to help other developers 
learn along with me.

You can find video tutorials on this project (and LibGDX generally) here:  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL_5eiPIzm--ppVBxGcSXQQ

Topics covered in this project for tutorial purposes are:

- A* Pathfinding
- Finite State Machines
- Box2D (Physics)
- Steering Behaviors
- AI in general
- And much more

I'm fairly busy, since I have a full-time job and other obligations and this is just my hobby.  Updates may be slow at times.
But if you have questions, or commentary, I'll try to respond when I can.
