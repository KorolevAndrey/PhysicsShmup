# PhysicsShmup

This code is for educational purposes.  You can use it in your own projects.  Generally, none of this code here is proprietary,
meaning it's written broadly enough to be used in a wide variety of projects.  

What is this project?  It's a 2D side-scrolling shmup indie game that is open for collaboration with anyone who wants to contribute.  The goal is to use this project to help expand the community.

The intent is to have this be a community game and give it away on Steam (or donate proceeds to charity) if I ever finish a version of it.  I figured since there aren't a lot of advanced tutorials on LibGDX around the web I'd put my code up here to help other developers learn along with me.

You can find video tutorials on this project (and LibGDX generally) here:  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL_5eiPIzm--ppVBxGcSXQQ

Topics covered in this project for tutorial purposes are:

- A* Pathfinding
- Finite State Machines
- Box2D (Physics)
- Steering Behaviors
- AI in general
- Multithreading
- And much more

I'm fairly busy, since I have a full-time job and other obligations and this is just my hobby.  Updates may be slow at times.
But if you have questions, or commentary, I'll try to respond when I can.
